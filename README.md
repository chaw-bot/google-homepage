The Odin Project, I never heard of it until a couple weeks ago, around the same time my desire to become a Web Developer grew. I've known for sometime know that I want to be a Web developer, but opportunities never seemed to come my way, thats a story for another. Prior to TOP, last year, I had tried some platforms that would help me with this journey. However, none of them motivated me, and kept me focused like TOP does. It's an easy to use platform, and well "stocked" with information. It brings a whole new meaning to self-studying. I'm only a few weeks in and I have learnt a lot on this platform. I can confidently say I will be a Web Developer by the end of this.
