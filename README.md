This is my first attempt at making a webpage, I'm sure you can see.
It's a basic Google homepage, and I tried to make it a little similar to the original one with some of the things I know. I used HTML and some CSS to write this code.
It's not yet finished but that's because I'm in a hurry to cover all I can, I'll definitely revisit it and make it a whole lot better.
